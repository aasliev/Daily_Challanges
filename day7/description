Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. 
The first line contains number of edges. The second line contains relation between nodes.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print inorder traversal of mirror tree.

Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function mirror that takes node as paramter.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 75
1 <= Number of nodes<= 100
1 <= Data of a node<= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
2 1 3
30 10 60 20 40

Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

>Input:

The first line contains T, denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case begins with a single positive
integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A.

>Output:

For each testcase, print "Yes" or  "No" whether it is Pythagorean Triplet or not (without quotes).

>Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

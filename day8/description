Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing height of blocks at index i as Ai where the width of each block is 1. 
Compute how much water can be trapped in between blocks after raining.
Structure is like below:
|  |
|_|
We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array, followed by N space separated numbers to be stored in array.

Output:
Output the total unit of water trapped in between the blocks.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
3 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= Ai <= 10^8

Given an array of size N. The task is to sort the array elements by completing functions heapify() and buildHeap() which are used to 
implement Heap Sort.

Input:
First line of the input denotes number of test cases T. First line of the test case is the size of array and second line consists of 
array elements.

Output:
Sorted array in ascending order.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

Example:
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
